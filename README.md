## Description
This repository contains a Google Collaboratory notebook that contains Python code that we used to clean and analyze data that 
contains information on the current situation of sanitation in the country. As data scientists, our main objective was to formulate a 
simple but smart strategy that would help the Kenyan government effectively carry out its plan to improve sanitation in the country.
In order to come up with this, we concentrated on cases that needed immediate attention such as determining counties and districts that
use bushes and buckets as a form of sanitation.
